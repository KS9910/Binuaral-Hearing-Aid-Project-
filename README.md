# Binuaral-Hearing-Aid-Project-
In this project, we are trying to design a hearing-aid which fixes the limitation of existing hearing-aid. 
The major objectives of our project are as follows:
Major Objectives
 • Fixing the limitation of existing hearing aids like prevention from unhygienic condition
 • Providing additional benefits like comfortable to wear over prolonged periods of use by
 the hearing-impaired users specially old-aged persons and children
 • Value for money product and less maintainance cost
 My role in this Project:
 • Channel Estimation of the system i.e. the physical hearing-aid model for acoustic feedback cancellation
 • Designed the amplifier circuits and a microphone array on a flexible PCB
